# Placement-of-Lizards-on-a-board-along-with-trees using Simulated Annealing, BFS & DFS and space/time comparison of all three

AI code similar to N Queens, but with modifications

# AIM : Place n Lizards on a board such that they dont attack each other on diagonal, row or column. Additionaly there are trees in some places which allow multiple lizards to be placed on a row or column or a diagonal wherever the conditions match.

# See screenshot 1 and 2 for graphical representation of the problem.
